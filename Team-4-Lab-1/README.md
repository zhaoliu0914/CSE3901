This is your class repo for a Lab.

You should create and assign issues in this repository for each task, and mark them completed as appropriate.  I will be monitoring the assignment of issues, and completion of tasks in considering your grades.

When a lab is finished, tag it Release 1.0.  IF you need to update after that, tag that as Release 1.1, etc.

For lab-3, start by copying all of lab-2 work into the lab-3 repository, and save that as a new commit.
